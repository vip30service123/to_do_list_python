Act as a Python Developer. You are given some functions and a requirement. Your task is to code based on these functions and the requirement.

### Functions
from psycopg2 import Error
from datetime import datetime
from typing import List, Dict, Optional, Any

def create_user(
    connection: Any,
    username: str,
    password: str
) -> bool:

    Create a new user in the USER table.
    
    Args:
        connection: PostgreSQL connection object
        username (str): Username for the new user
        password (str): Password for the new user
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if user creation successful, False otherwise

    try:
        cursor = connection.cursor()

        print(f"Error while reading users: {error}")
        return []


### Requirement
Write an fastapi file that has 2 functions:
- Sign up: Use function read_users to check if the user is already created. If not, create a user using create_user and return suitablt status code. The attributes should contain username, password, and password_again.
- Log in: Use function read_users to check if the user is already created. Return suitatble status code.
The code must use APIRouter from fastapi, tags = ['authentication']
